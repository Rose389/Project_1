    <h2>Dance Attire</h2>
    <p> We have special requirements for different classes.The dress code permits the faculty to evaluate and correct student alignment and body extension. The dress code creates a sense of group identity and eliminates the need for students to compete with each other through attire. Some classes require hair to be placed in a pony tail or bun. Students may not wear extra layers, as they obstruct the view of proper placement of the body. Attire is available for sale to non-students as well. We carry Danskin, Body Wrappers, Revolution, Dasha, Horizon Dance Bags, PonyBuns, etc. Dancers must wear cover-ups to and from class.</p>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Andria's hosts an annual SPRING CONCERT at SMU's McFarlin Auditorium. Participation is optional but encouraged. By participating, students showcase the skills they have learned and practiced while experiencing a stage performance. Stage performances encourage our dancers to reach learning goals by perfecting their routines. Costume(s) and concert fees are due in the fall semester.</p>
    <p>Andria's is also proud to offer master classes with guest artists and choreographers as well as dance seminars, conventions, examinations, and competitions.

    <h2>Award Ceremonies</h2>
    <p>Andria's represents students in voluntary dance examinations (Ballet, Pointe, Tap, and Jazz). Award ceremonies are held at the end of the year. Trophies are also awarded to dancers who have completed 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 consecutive years at the studio. In recognition of specific skills accomplished by our dancers, ribbons are awarded periodically. Additional recognition goes out to graduating seniors.</p>
    <h2>FAQ: What to look for in a dance studio?</h2>

    <p>2 - Strong ballet program-A strong ballet program brings proper technique training to the dancers. A proper foundation in ballet is important for all types of dance-even helps cheerleaders, drill team dancers, musical theater, ice skaters, gymnasts, and sports players.</p>

We have a better connection among our students and parents that way. We are about quality over quantity. Our small class sizes promote camaraderie among dancers and instructors, nurturing the teaching-learning process, and allowing ample space for movement of dancer.</p>
    <p>6 - Systematic graded levels of classes. Each level has certain steps, skills, and terminology to be mastered.  So, you know that your child will learn and progress.

    <p>7 - Performance opportunities. Not only do we have the year end show at SMU, but we have a community service group called Angela’s Angels that shares their talent with others. And our older Angels are offered the opportunity to perfect their dance skills in these venues as well as in a few competitions.</p>
    <p>8 - All ages: from as young as 2 year olds to Sizzling Seniors. You are never too young or wise to learn to dance! For the dancer looking for fun and exercise to the more serious dancer, there are classes for all.</p>
