        <h4>Spring Dance Concert</h4>
		<p>This is a wonderful opportunity for dancers 
		to present themselves and what they have learned 
		throughout the year. It is held at the historic McFarlin Auditorium on Southern Methodist University campus. Dancers perform in front of hundreds of family members with professional lighting, backdrops, stage crews, and sound equipment. This is the graduation at the end of the year.</p>
		<br>

		<h4>Competitions</h4>
		<p>The company dancers have the opportunity for 
		some of their performances in competitions to improve their skills competing among themselves and other dancers of their age.</p>
		<br>

		<h4>Andrea's Dreamers</h4>
		<p>Dancers ages 4-adults perform at various community 
		events sharing their gift of dance with others. They also perform at the show at the end of the year. These dancers learn to perfect their stage presence  as well as how to interact with others such as seniors in our community. See our community page for more info. Another opportunity to dance than just class.</p>
